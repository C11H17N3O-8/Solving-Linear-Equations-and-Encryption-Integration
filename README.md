# Solving-Linear-Equations-and-Encryption-Integration
In this project, we have implemented a Python program to randomly generate and solve simultaneous linear equations. Additionally, we have introduced a simple encryption mechanism, where the coefficients of the equations are encrypted for added security.
The goal is to provide an interactive learning experience and showcase basic encryption concepts in the context of linear equations.

The core functionalities of the program include:

1. Simultaneous Linear Equation Solver: The program generates random sets of linear equations and solves them to find the intersection points (if they exist) or the slope, x-intercept, and y-intercept of a single line. The solution is presented in the form of fractions to ensure accurate results.

2. Encryption and Decryption: To introduce a security element, the coefficients of the generated linear equations are encrypted using a simple encryption algorithm. We double the coefficients to encrypt them and then divide them by 2 for decryption. The user is presented with encrypted coefficients, which are decrypted during the solving process to obtain the original coefficients.

The program prompts the user with questions related to linear equations and requests the corresponding answers. Depending on the user's input, it will display either a single line's properties or the intersection points of two lines. Graphs are also generated to visually represent the equations and their solutions.

Please note that the encryption used in this project is for illustrative purposes only and should not be considered secure for real-world applications. For stronger encryption, advanced cryptographic algorithms should be employed.

By combining mathematical problem-solving with basic encryption concepts, this project aims to enhance users' understanding of linear equations and provide an introduction to the fundamentals of encryption.
